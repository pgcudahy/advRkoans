# advRkoans
advRkoans is an interactive tutorial for learning advanced R programming language by making tests pass. 
Following Hadley Wickham's [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/). 
Inspired by Greg Malcom's [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans), 
which are in turn inspired by Edgecase's [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/).
